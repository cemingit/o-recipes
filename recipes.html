        <h2>Recipe Numero Uno:
            Philly Cheese Steak Dip
        </h2>

        <p>This Philly cheesesteak dip would make a handsome addition to your snack table for the Big Game. Like all great party foods, it's wonderful hot, warm, room temp, and, I've heard from a reliable source, even delicious cold. Serve alongside sliced baguette. Keep it hot and fresh for guests by baking it in 2 batches, or feel free to do this all at once in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
        <p>

        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice steak into thick pieces. Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over high heat until smoking. Add steak slices and sear until bottoms are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and reduce heat to medium. Cook until juices appear on the tops, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl to cool.</li>
            <li>Add diced onion, a big pinch of salt, and butter to the meat juices in the pan. Cook and stir over medium heat, scraping up the browned bits, until onions start to soften, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>and it goes on...</li>
        </ol>
